# HD Wallets
## What is an HD Wallet?

HD wallets are hierarchical deterministic wallets proposed in BIP-32 in order to avoid the trouble of managing a bunch of private keys. HD wallets allow selective sharing on multiple keypairs (private and public keys) that are generated from a single root. The seed is represented by mnemonic code (phrase) that consists of 12 words, which makes it easier for account holders to transcribe and memorize.

## TronLink Wallets - HD Wallets

TronLink wallets support BIP-32 and BIP-44 proposals, and generate the corresponding TRON addresses based on the BIP-44 hierarchical sub-path.

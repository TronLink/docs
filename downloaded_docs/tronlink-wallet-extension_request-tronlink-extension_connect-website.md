# Connect Website

**DEPRECATED** The methods in this section are deprecated and are expected to be removed in a few releases. The TRON community is discussing new specifications, you can go to [TRON-TIP](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/issues/463) to participate in the discussion.

**Connect Website**

**Overview**

TronLink supports TRX transfers, contract signature, authorization, etc. initiated by DApps. For security considerations, users are required to authorize the DApp to “connect website”. They can take further actions only after successful authorization. The DApp must first connect to the website, and wait for the user's permission before it can initiate a request for authorization.

**Specification**

**Example**

Copy
    
    
    const res = await tronWeb.request(
      {
        method: 'tron_requestAccounts',
        params: {
          websiteIcon: '<WEBSITE ICON URI>',
          websiteName: '<WEBSITE NAME>',
        },
      }
    )

**Parameters**

Copy
    
    
    interface RequestAccountsParams {
      websiteIcon?: string;
      websiteName?: string;
    }

**Returns**

Copy
    
    
    interface ReqestAccountsResponse {
      code: 200 | 4000 | 4001,
      message: string
    }
